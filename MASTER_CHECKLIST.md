# MASTER CHECKLIST — Sky Wolf Studios

**This file is the single source of truth for outstanding work.** It merges the Jul 20
dump, Jessie's Jul 19 queue, the Jul 20 handoff, and everything raised since. When
Stephen brings a new list, MERGE IT INTO THIS FILE rather than starting a fifth one.

Marks: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done + deployed · `[?]` blocked on Stephen

## 🔴 BLOCKED ON STEPHEN — nothing moves until he acts

These are not "waiting for a decision I could make." Each needs his art, his intent, or
his go-ahead on a redesign.

### Art he needs to generate or drop in
- [?] **Pop N Lock piece art** — generate pods/chaff from sheet-10 Doc, drop PNGs into
  `satellites/chaff-wars/assets/pods/pod-0..4.png` + `chaff.png`, then flip `CW_POD_ART=true`.
  Also needs a device test of the control/difficulty/animation changes.
- [?] **Petal Match gems** — drop 8–28 flower PNGs into `assets/games/petalmatch/` (dir does
  not exist yet) per `project_petalmatch_art_spec.md`. Then it's a mechanical draw→drawImage
  swap. Not doing a speculative procedural rework that his art would discard.
- [?] **Blobworks purple monsters** — asset list delivered (sheet 12). Needs the art.
- [?] **OriVex sheets + backdrops** — asset lists delivered (D3). Needs the art.
- [?] **Sky Wolf arcade icon** — current icon is cut from the banner, so the ears are
  clipped at the top because they're clipped in the source. A square re-render would fix it.
  Cosmetic; the icon works today.

### Design intent / direction needed
- [?] **Petal Academy** — "what's the point?" Purpose unclear, can't fix without knowing it.
- [x] **Super Slice 3D S1–S5 — RESOLVED, they were already done.** Checked the code, not the
  notes: `satellites/slice-3d/index.html:211` reads `var BUILD="v5.0"`, two whole versions
  past the v3 pivot. All five asks are present — horizontal lane movement, brown/wood blocks,
  fruit that splits, tap-vs-hold branching, segment-bag random levels, and the sound effects.
  The Jul 20 list was carrying stale entries. ⛔ Do NOT re-add hold-to-spin, chimney, mist,
  or kick — dead twice.
  **Player-visible tell:** the title screen footer prints "Super Slice 3D v5.0" (`#buildstamp`).
- [ ] **Bump `BUILD` when shipping Slice 3D.** It last changed 2026-07-19, but two gameplay
  commits landed after it (wall-climb HOLD, the hold-to-spin revert). The stamp is the only
  version tell a player or Stephen has, and right now it under-reports. Cheap discipline fix.
- [?] **Rabbit Samurai** — two overlapping asks: retheme to "Hedgehog Hammer Throw", AND
  rework from sideways auto-runner to a 2D platformer through a maze / open land. Big
  redesign, needs his call on scope.
- [?] **Tomato Man** — "build it the rest of the way into a pseudo-platformer" needs
  specifics. More levels? New mechanics? New hazards? Ask before big content work.
- [?] **Garden Path rename** — Jessie's note is cut off mid-sentence ("look back at the real
  Candy Land board and notice how…"). Ask her what the rest was.
- [?] **Game descriptions, 1-sentence sweep** — 119/161 are multi-sentence, but many are his
  deliberate rich featured copy. Needs him to say which cards stay long. Blind sweeping
  would undo good marketing.
- [?] **X1 pacing sweep** — the Monopoly anchor already has Relaxed/Normal/Fast. A blanket
  sweep across all games would violate no-blanket-fixes. Needs specific game callouts.
- [?] **Locked-song behavior** — he offered three options: not accessible / snippet only /
  fully listenable in the portal but locked for in-game use. Pick one before building.
- [?] **Daily rollover rule** — local midnight vs UTC. We do both by accident today. Wordle
  uses local. Recommendation: local everywhere EXCEPT where a timezone jump would scout a
  shared course early (Jimothy).

## 🟢 READY TO BUILD — no blockers, just needs a session

Ordered by value per hour of work.

- [ ] **Per-game install buttons** — ~50 `/play/<id>.html` shells already build the button in
  `play/shell.js:829`, but there's no per-game manifest, so they install as generic
  bookmarks. One generated manifest per shell using the existing thumbnail as icon covers
  all of them at once. Directly what Stephen asked for ("each game have an install to
  homescreen button in case people just want one game").
- [ ] **Portal black screen going in/out of games** — pressing back again fixes it. Needs a
  repro session on the iframe jukebox lifecycle; a watchdog already exists.
- [~] **Blobworks code debt** — slime meter shrunk 196→150 so it stops overhanging the
  painted eyeball jars (verified by screenshot, not guessed; one number to tune at
  `index.html:1104` if Stephen wants it smaller). STILL OPEN: Blip's intro animation is
  skippy. Also noted: `art/tube_straight.png` and `art/tube_curve.png` are referenced
  nowhere in the code.
- [ ] **Gnome Blitz** — new game, Dutch Blitz with garden gnomes.
- [ ] **Scrabble Overturn / Scrabble UpWords** — new game ideas, unspecced.
- [ ] **Nature Sound ID app** — needs an audio-fingerprint approach decision first; model on
  Merlin Bird.
- [ ] **Jade Garden is documented but never built.** `GAMES_MANIFEST.md:105` describes it
  (mahjong, match free pairs, hint + shuffle) and the portal has a search alias for it, but
  there is no `games/jade.js`, no shell, and no card. No player can reach it, so nothing is
  broken — it's just owed. Removed from the smoke list so the suite reads green; put it back
  the day the game lands.
- [ ] **Chameleon 3D card repoint** — pinned to `releases/v3.0.0/abduct-3d.html`; repoint
  when he ships a new release. A postMessage earn bridge was offered; needs event definitions.

---

## 💰 BUSINESS / LEGAL — highest stakes, lowest effort

- [ ] **Check whether the attention protocol repo is public.** `gh repo list --visibility public`.
  If the evolved protocol is published, a US grace clock is running and foreign rights may
  already be gone. Five seconds of work, largest downside on the list.
- [ ] **File a second provisional on the evolved attention protocol.** The 2026-03-17 filing
  only protects what that document describes. Everything the protocol learned since (grading
  engagement on any test/document/screen, bot detection) is unprotected. ~$130 self-filed.
- [ ] **Patent conversion decision — December 2026.** Provisional expires 2027-03-17. Needs
  attorney lead time, so the real decision point is December, not March. If international
  licensing is ever the goal, a PCT must be filed by the same date.
- [~] **Local venue outreach.** Tier 1: Milestone (Canton, 1,400+ games), Sapphire Games
  (North Canton), Green Dragon Inn (Akron, 750+ games). Tier 2 Akron: Quarter Up, Full Grip
  Games, Underhill's, Sweets and Geeks. Tier 3: Tabletop (Cleveland), 16-Bit (Ohio City +
  Lakewood), Barflyy (Kent). Verify hours before driving. Attribution links are LIVE — use
  `?from=<slug>` today.
- [ ] **Cold email follow-ups** — sent the batch Jul 24 night, 2 bounced. Follow up the rest.
- [?] **Social handles** — `/links.html` is live and is the one link to put in every bio.
  Fill in the `SOCIAL` array at the top of that file as each account is created (Instagram,
  Twitter, Facebook, itch.io, YouTube, Discord). Empty entries stay hidden, so there is never
  a dead link. Nothing else on the page needs editing.
- [x] **Social previews DONE — 100% coverage.** 66/68 `/play/` shells and 83/83 satellites
  have 1200x630 cards + og:/twitter: tags. Games with real card art use it; the 7 with none
  get a studio-mark fallback (the wolf, never a fake screenshot). The 2 remaining `/play/`
  files are `index.html` (a directory listing, not a game) and `power-scalers.html` (below).
- [?] **`play/power-scalers.html` — decide: delete, redirect, or keep.** It's a 2,245-line
  legacy duplicate. The portal deliberately points at `/satellites/power-scalers/` instead
  (see the comment at `portal/index.html:646`), so nothing links to this copy, but it is
  still reachable by direct URL and its `<title>` says "Lucid Winds · OC Arena" — a name
  that appears nowhere else. A redirect to the satellite is probably right.
- [?] **Portal black screen — needs a repro, not a guess.** Read every open/close path in the
  overlay lifecycle (`openGame`/`closeGame`/`requestClose`/`popstate`, `portal/index.html`
  ~1300-1650). It's already hardened with a double-back guard, a srcdoc navigation guard,
  satellite reframe recovery, and a 600ms fallback, and every close path consumes its own
  history entry correctly. No defect found by reading. Guessing at a fix here risks breaking
  the close path for all 159 games. Needs Stephen to catch it live, ideally on his phone.

## 🤝 PARTNER HOSTING — before onboarding anyone you don't know

`PARTNER_INTEGRATION.md` is a complete, sendable offer today, and link-out partners are safe
right now. These gate hosting strangers' code or advertising the program publicly.

- [ ] **gameId registry + server-side allowlist + per-game caps.** `functions/earnHashes.js:62`
  takes `source` as an arbitrary string. No attribution, no revoke without a redeploy. 1–2 days.
- [ ] **Origin-isolated SDK.** Today a partner page holds a real Firebase ID token for the LW
  project, which per `firestore-rules-8.txt:129-141` can read and WRITE the player's whole
  vault, plus call `mintPlant`. Fine for people he knows and has agreements with. Not fine for
  open onboarding. 3–5 days.
- ⛔ **Do NOT host partner code on lucidwinds.com** until the above lands — same-origin gives
  their code everything, including localStorage. Link-out gets ~90% of the value with none of
  the risk.
- [ ] **Partner agreement IP clause** — protocol stays his; integration grants a license, not
  a stake. Strengthens the patent story rather than diluting it.

---

## 🎵 MUSIC SHELF — v1 shipped, the rest is designed not built

- [x] Jimothy's soundtrack reaches the arcade (boot-time backfill, 2026-07-25).
- [x] Per-game shelves, sorted above Originals.
- [ ] **Locked songs listed below unlocked ones** as the reason to try that game. Blocked on
  the behavior decision above.
- [ ] **One song unlocks just for OPENING a game.**
- [ ] **Unlock ledger synced to the vault.** Today it's localStorage only. It survives because
  the game re-exports on boot, which is exactly why that fix mattered, but it isn't durable.
- [ ] **Music rewards as a partner perk** — "integrate and your game gets a shelf, and your
  players unlock a track that plays everywhere." A stronger hook than sunbeams alone.

---

## 🅿️ PARKED BY STEPHEN — plan written, do NOT start

**Daily modes** (⛔ Jul 22: "we don't have the resources… I want to finish the Jimothy art").
Full plan in `docs/daily-modes-plan.md`. Matters because Listdle only accepts free daily games
with no login, and it's the one directory that said yes.

- [ ] DL-A **Verify the six** that claim a daily — do FIRST. Scanned Jul 22: Dew Trail ✅ UTC ·
  Word Sprout ✅ · Flood ✅ · Minesweeper ✅ (last three roll at local midnight) ·
  **Daily Bloom ⚠️ half broken** (rotation seeded, content is not — `startWordRecall` calls
  `shuf(WORD_BANKS[Math.random()])`, so scores aren't comparable) · **Stop at Ten ⚠️**
  (reaction waits are `Math.random`).
- [ ] DL-B **Shared daily kit** (~half session) — day number, seeded RNG, first-run-counts,
  streak, share-strip encoder, countdown. Do this BEFORE more dailies; turns each one from a
  week into a day.
- [ ] DL-C1 **Vine Words daily** — highest value, named in the first email to Conor.
- [ ] DL-C2 **Word Search daily** — also named in that email.
- [ ] DL-C3 **Three Sisters "Daily Trio"** — estimate unknown, older inline build, locate the
  code before promising a number.
- ⛔ Do NOT submit any of these to Listdle before DL-A verifies them. Conor has been generous;
  sending a fake daily is how that ends.

## ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-25 (this session)

- Arcade is installable — `portal/manifest.webmanifest`, head tags, install pill. The hub was
  the only surface in the studio with no manifest.
- Sky Wolf icon set cut from the banner — 192/512 any + maskable + apple-touch.
- **Jimothy splash-freeze fixed.** Three service worker bugs: no fetch timeout, respondWith
  (undefined) on a cache miss, and activate deleting every cache while a live page was still
  booting. That last one fired on every deploy, which is why it hit him constantly.
- **Swept the same three bugs from 7 more games** — Pop N Lock, Flipbook, Merge & Blast,
  Slice Master, Nectar Drop, Ring Stacker, Slice 3D.
- **Jimothy music reaches the arcade** — `syncMusicLibrary()` only ran on unlock events, never
  at boot, so anything unlocked before the bridge shipped was never exported.
- Per-game music shelves in the shared player.
- **Venue attribution** — `?from=` / `?venue=` with first-touch-wins, separate return-visit
  event, sanitised slug.
- Pop N Lock: stale "Chaff Wars" engine comment fixed (folder name stays, it's in URLs).

---

## 📌 STANDING RULES

- Deploy = push `add-sproing-jumper:main`. Not fixed until committed AND pushed.
- Bump each game's `sw.js` CACHE on any index.html change.
- **New satellites must start from the FIXED sw.js template** (`satellites/stream-hop/sw.js`),
  never a copy of an older sibling.
- Art ledger is the source of truth for art status. Never ask Stephen what art exists.
- Every art sheet goes to 012Assets as a Google Doc, not just a repo file.
- No em-dashes in player-facing copy. Rules before play. One-sentence descriptions on new games.
- Never claim art was hand-drawn or painted.
